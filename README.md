# Data-Cleaning-Portfolio-Project
In this project, I worked with Nashville Housing data. I conducted through assessment of the raw data to identify data quality issues like missing values, duplicates and inconsistencies. Further, I enhanced the reliability and usability of the dataset and made it suitable for further analysis and reporting. To accomplish the above tasks, I used tool like MSSQL Server.
